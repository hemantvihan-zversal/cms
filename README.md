## Development

> **Heads up!** The WordPress site that this was built against is no longer active. You'll need to create your own WordPress instance and update the URL at `lib/apollo.js` to build this site.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
